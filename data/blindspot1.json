		"Academic Perspective": "I need to get these deliverables out before the end of the academic school year The fiscal year end is not convenient because I am just starting classes and getting to know students I need time to mobilize and be thorough.  And I am not able to travel much during the academic year due to my teaching requirements. It's difficult to hire graduate students in the middle of the semester or end their appoitnments half way of the semester unless I have other projects to pick them up. ",
